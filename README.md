## Results 

-Vine reivews: 4781

-Non-vine reviews: 332395

-Five-star vine reviews: 1604

-Five-star non-vine reviews: 168800

-Percentage of five-star reviews (vine): 33.55%

-Percentage of five-star reviews (non-vine): 50.78%

## Summary 

In the case of this book review dataset, there is no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program because the percentage of five star reviews for members in the Vine program was actually lower than the percentage of five star for non members. 

An additional anaylsis that can be performed with this dataset is looking for positivity or negativity bias in non-verified purchases.
